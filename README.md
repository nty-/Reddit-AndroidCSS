CSS for www.reddit.com/r/android

How to set it up:
=================
1. Copy the CSS from AndroidCSS.txt to your stylesheet.

2. upload the images from the 'stylesheet images' folder to your stylesheet.

3. upload 'headerimg.png' to /r/subreddit/about/edit

4. While you're there, you can set up the banner text. In your sidebar, put a line of text that you want the banner to have, for example 'Welcome to /r/Mysubreddit!'. Preceding the line, put 6 '#' symbols.
   In this example, the line of text would look like '######Welcome to my subreddit!'

5. You'll need to change logowhite.png and logoblack.png to say your subreddit name. If you have Adobe Fireworks (or maybe Photoshop), you should be able to open the files and edit the text directly.
   They use 28pt Roboto font. The white logo uses the 'regular' font weight, and the black one is the 'light' fontweight. 
   
   You can get both fonts free, here: http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto
   
   At the top of the stylesheet is the customization section. You may need to adjust the widths and heights for the logos there if they get cut off or don't look right.

6. Customize the colors! 
   There are two color's you'll need to change:
   
   -The first is the header color. This color is only appears once in the CSS.
   -The second is the accent/secondary color. You'll need to change this color in three places. 
   -All of them and the header color can be found in the customization section a the top.
